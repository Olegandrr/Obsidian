If you are rendering your component using JSX, the name of that component has to begin with a capital letter otherwise React will throw an error as an unrecognized tag. This convention is because only HTML elements and SVG tags can begin with a lowercase letter.

```js
class SomeComponent extends Component {
  // Code goes here
}
```

You can define component class which name starts with lowercase letter, but when it's imported it should have capital letter. Here lowercase is fine:

```js
class myComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    return <div />;
  }
}

export default myComponent;
```

While when imported in another file it should start with capital letter:

```js
import MyComponent from "./myComponent";
```

The component names should start with an uppercase letter but there are few exceptions to this convention. The lowercase tag names with a dot (property accessors) are still considered as valid component names. For example, the below tag can be compiled to a valid component,

```js
     render() {
          return (
            <obj.component/> // `React.createElement(obj.component)`
          )
    }
```
